# Luxury Home Valuation Methodology — Indianapolis

This document outlines the valuation methodology used by Kris Bashenow to analyze and price luxury residential properties in the Indianapolis metropolitan area.

## Core Valuation Principles

Luxury real estate valuation differs from standard residential analysis. Comparable sales alone are insufficient when analyzing architecturally unique, custom-built, or location-sensitive properties.

Valuation incorporates multiple layers:

- Comparable market sales
- Replacement cost analysis
- Location-specific demand patterns
- Architectural uniqueness and design quality
- Lot characteristics and site value
- Buyer behavior in luxury segments
- Market timing and absorption rates

## Replacement Cost Consideration

Replacement cost establishes a valuation floor in many luxury housing scenarios. Buyers evaluate not only existing comparable sales, but also the cost and feasibility of recreating the asset.

This is particularly relevant in neighborhoods such as:

- Meridian-Kessler
- Butler-Tarkington
- Meridian Hills
- Williams Creek

## Market Behavior Patterns

Luxury buyers often behave differently than general market participants. Decisions are influenced by:

- Emotional attachment to specific properties
- Architectural significance
- Scarcity of comparable alternatives
- Long-term ownership outlook

## Application

This methodology is applied when advising clients on pricing, acquisition, and disposition strategy for higher-value residential properties in central Indianapolis.
